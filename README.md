# Device Association
Device Association Component provides restful services for associating the device with a user, retrieving association details and terminating/suspending (when user doesnâ€™t have any active subscription)/restoring devices. It also provides restful services for Many-to-Many Association and Terminations.

## Getting Started

To build the project in the local working directory after the project has been cloned/forked, run:

```mvn clean install```

from the command line interface.

### Prerequisites

The list of tools required to build and run the project:
    * Java 17
    * Maven 3.8 or higher

Download and Install Apache Maven 3.8 locally and follow the below steps:
* Go to the right corner of the IDE and get inside the Maven option.
* Select the Maven Settings option and set the Maven Home Path to the path of the Apache Maven 3.8 installed locally.
* Click Apply and then OK.

2. Postgres DB needs to be installed and database/schema should be created with the required tables.

* Link of the database and table scripts to be installed :
  [dmpostgres.sql](../../../ecsp-helm-charts/blob/main/postgresql/db-scripts/dmpostgres.sql)

### Installation

[Install Java](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-17-lts&package=jdk#zulu)

[How to set up Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

### Coding style check configuration

[checkstyle.xml](./association-api/checkstyle.xml) is the coding standard to follow while writing new/updating existing code.

Checkstyle plugin [maven-checkstyle-plugin:3.2.1](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/) is integrated in [pom.xml](./pom.xml) which runs in the validate phase and check goal of the maven lifecycle and fails the build if there are any checkstyle errors in the project.

To run checkstyle plugin explicitly, run the following command: mvn checkstyle:check

### Running the tests

To run the tests for this system run the below maven command.

```mvn test```

Or run a specific test

```mvn test -Dtest="TheFirstUnitTest"```

To run a method from within a test

```mvn test -Dtest="TheSecondUnitTest#whenTestCase2_thenPrintTest2_1"```

### Deployment

The component can be deployed as a Kubernetes pod by installing Device factory management charts.
Link: [Charts](../../../ecsp-helm-charts/tree/main/association)

Postgres DB needs to be installed and ignite database/schema should be created with the required tables.
Link of the database and table scripts to be installed: [dmpostgres.sql](https://github.com/eclipse-ecsp/ecsp-helm-charts/blob/main/postgresql/db-scripts/dmpostgres.sql)

## Usage

Device Association microservice can be used to associate devices to users, fetch association details of a device, terminate or suspend an existing association and restore suspended associations. It can also be used for Many-to-Many Associations and Terminations where multiple devices can be associated with multiple users.
Devices are associated with the user and maintained in PostgreSQL DB with the Device State as READY_TO_ACTIVATE and Association Status as ASSOCIATION_INITIATED.
