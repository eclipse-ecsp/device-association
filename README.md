# Device Association
Device Association Component provides restful services for associating the device with a user, retrieving association details and terminating/suspending (when user doesnâ€™t have any active subscription)/restoring devices. It also provides restful services for Many-to-Many Association and Terminations.

## Getting Started

To build the project in the local working directory after the project has been cloned/forked, run:

```mvn clean install```

from the command line interface.

### Prerequisites

1. The list of tools required to build and run the project:
   JDK 17
   Apache Maven 3.8

Download and Install Apache Maven 3.8 locally and follow the below steps for IntelliJ IDE:
* Go to the right corner of the IDE and get inside the Maven option.
* Select the Maven Settings option and set the Maven Home Path to the path of the Apache Maven 3.8 installed locally.
* Click Apply and then OK.

2. Postgres DB needs to be installed and database/schema should be created with the required tables.

* Link of the database and table scripts to be installed :
  [dmpostgres.sql](../../../csp-opensource-charts/blob/main/postgresql/db-scripts/dmpostgres.sql)

3. Add below secrets using secret.yaml:

```
{
  "vehicle-association-service": {
    "service_notification_kafka_client_key_password": "**********",
    "service_notification_kafka_client_keystore_password": "*********",
    "service_notification_kafka_client_truststore_password": "********",
    "service_user_auth_password": "***********",
    "client_id": "device-mgmt",
    "client_secret": "*******"
  }
}
```

* service_notification_kafka_client_key_password : it is the client key password to connect with Kafka.
* service_notification_kafka_client_keystore_password : it is the client keystore password to connect with Kafka.
* service_notification_kafka_client_truststore_password : it is the client truststore password to connect with Kafka.
* service_user_auth_password : used to generate the user auth token.
* client_id and client_secret : fields used to connect with uidam server.

### Installation

[How to set up Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

[Install Java](https://www.tutorials24x7.com/java/how-to-install-openjdk-17-on-windows)


### Coding style check configuration

[checkstyle.xml](./association-api/checkstyle.xml) is the coding standard to follow while writing new/updating existing code.

Checkstyle plugin [maven-checkstyle-plugin:3.2.1](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-checkstyle-plugin/) is integrated in [pom.xml](./pom.xml) which runs in the `validate` phase and `check` goal of the maven lifecycle and fails the build if there are any checkstyle errors in the project.

There are a few coding guidelines to be followed manually before requesting for a pull request, the same can be found here:

[Manual coding guidelines](Link to page with coding guidelines)

### Running the tests

To run the tests for this system run the below maven command.

```mvn test```

Or run a specific test

```mvn test -Dtest="TheFirstUnitTest"```

To run a method from within a test

```mvn test -Dtest="TheSecondUnitTest#whenTestCase2_thenPrintTest2_1"```

### Deployment

We can deploy this component as a Kubernetes pod by installing Device Association charts.

Link:
[Charts](../../../csp-opensource-charts/tree/main/association)

Detailed information about the request and response generated by the [Device Association restful services](Refer to API specifics of device-association).

## Architecture

Sequence diagram of device association with user:

[<img src="./images/associationSequenceDiagram.png" width="800" height="300"/>](associationSequenceDiagram.png)

## Usage

Device Association microservice can be used to associate devices to users, fetch association details of a device, terminate or suspend an existing association and restore suspended associations. It can also be used for Many-to-Many Associations and Terminations where multiple devices can be associated with multiple users.
Devices are associated with the user and maintained in PostgreSQL DB with the Device State as READY_TO_ACTIVATE and Association Status as ASSOCIATION_INITIATED.
